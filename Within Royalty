Within the group are so many. Accepted in different locals, if you have reaped any reward or gift from this group you are included and have rights and responsibilities, we take this point very seriously. We don't usually eliminate people from life but we do educate so speak carefully and concisely to us. Do edit for slang and correct miscommunication and misinterpertations hasteily. There is many legs of this group and a proper chain of command. The perks are numerous and so are the restored credits as long as your agreed upon responsibilities are being met. We are a way of life. Some of you have tenor and senority with us but this is not arranged as a democratic organization, not to say you don't have personal choices you do have many, on occasion we all are expected to obey. I also have members of this group I answer too, like any monarchy, I also have people I take advisement from. We don't just whatever we please to ourselves, to each other or to our stuff. Consent still does matter. If you decide to desolve our relationship. You will go before council and PQ to be heard of what your reasons are, we will do everything in our power to come to a peaceful resolution and seal your membership NDA only to be seen in the event of your murder with our Tiger's Eye and with local detectives as soon as we learn of your murder. with us if disolvement is what is the final decisiom We do look for our people frequently and often and your absense will be noticed. This point does not mean the lab will rebirth the person stat do get you out of sanctions.
